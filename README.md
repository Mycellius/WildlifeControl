# Wildlife Control

Wildlife Control is a mod for RimWorld that allows you to limit the number of wild animals on a map without affecting colony animals, enemy animals, or visitor animals. The mod removes excess animals once every in-game day based on their health conditions, age, and species group size. Set a maximum number of wild animals and the mod will maintain the limit by removing animals according to the specified criteria.
